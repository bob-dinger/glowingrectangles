## No Scroll Policy
Users should scroll as little as possible. Each page should fit on one screen at a reasonable desktop size (not optimized for phones).

- Use fixed sidebars for context/explanations instead of stacking content vertically
- Keep visualizations compact and self-contained
- If content must extend, prefer horizontal layouts or steppers over vertical scrolling
