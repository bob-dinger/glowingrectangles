Session Transcript - January 2, 2026
=====================================

Context from previous session:
- Added over-explorers pages, grifters page, scroll page, comfort visualization
- Fixed DNS issues with glowingrectangles.io
- Set up www subdomain (still pointing to Gandi redirect, needs fixing later)

---

USER: (checking www.glowingrectangles.io status)

CLAUDE: Let me verify that www.glowingrectangles.io is fully working now.
[Tested - main domain working (200), www still not connecting]
[DNS check showed www still pointing to webredir.vip.gandi.net instead of GitHub Pages]

The www subdomain is still pointing to Gandi's web redirect service instead of GitHub Pages. The existing record is overriding the CNAME you added.

In Gandi's DNS settings, look for an existing www record and delete it. Then make sure your CNAME record is:
- Name: www
- Type: CNAME
- Hostname: bob-dinger.github.io.

---

USER: ok I'm not worried about it yet

CLAUDE: No problem. The main site at https://glowingrectangles.io/ is working fine. You can sort out the www subdomain whenever you feel like it.

---

USER: yes. we'll worry about it later

CLAUDE: Sounds good. What's next?

---

USER: hmm. invisible gorilla>

CLAUDE: The famous inattentional blindness experiment - people so focused on counting basketball passes that they completely miss a gorilla walking through the scene.

Are you thinking of making a page about this? Could be a powerful visualization about what we miss when we're focused on the wrong things.

---

USER: yes. a page. throw the ball around. ask them to count. the randomly put the gorilla in there...

CLAUDE: Love it. Let me create an interactive version of the experiment.

[Created gorilla.html with:]
- Canvas animation with white and black team players
- Ball passing between players
- User asked to count passes by white team
- Gorilla walks through at 6-9 second mark
- Modal asks how many passes counted and if they saw gorilla
- Reveals inattentional blindness concept

[Created images/gorilla.svg for home page thumbnail]
[Added to index.html]

---

USER: ok. add to the front page. I'm gonna have to check a lot of what we did tomorrow

CLAUDE: Already added to the home page. Let me push everything so you can check it tomorrow.

[Committed and pushed: "Add Invisible Gorilla interactive experiment"]

Pushed. It'll be live at https://glowingrectangles.io in a minute. See you tomorrow.

---

USER: yeah. I don't think it works that well. I want to do a joke scene that links to the video. but again..let's worry about it later

CLAUDE: Got it. We can rework it later - maybe a simple setup that builds anticipation then links to the actual Simons & Chabris video. That might land better than trying to recreate it.

---

USER: hmm. yeah that gorilla is very obvious here

CLAUDE: Yeah, the real experiment works because you're watching actual people in a chaotic scene and the gorilla blends in more. In a simple animation with 6 circles, a big black shape walking through is impossible to miss.

Linking to the real video is the right call. We'll fix it later.

---

USER: right. but still. we can do better. the gorilla is too obvious. but still. whatever I just saw was waaaay too obvious. so it needs to be refined

CLAUDE: Agreed. The gorilla needs to be way more subtle - maybe smaller, more similar colors to the players, or have more visual chaos happening so there's actually something to miss. Right now it's like a billboard walking through.

We'll refine it when you're ready.

---

USER: ok I'm gonna restart. let's write this entire session to a transcript .txt file in this folder

---

TODO for next session:

**Priority:**
1. Review all changes made in previous sessions

**To Fix:**
2. Refine invisible gorilla page - make gorilla more subtle or link to actual video
3. Fix www.glowingrectangles.io subdomain (remove old redirect record in Gandi)

**Later:**
- [ ] Run `node fetch-noun-icons.js` to continue fetching Freepik icons (hit daily rate limit at 271/1356)
- [ ] Update spanish-nouns-launch.html to use Freepik PNGs with emoji fallback
